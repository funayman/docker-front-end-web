# Front-End Web Stack

Rather than clutter my machine with a bunch of web tools, I use this as a base.

## Current Web Tools Installed
* npm
* yarn
* grunt
* less
* jshint

## To-Do
* Include Sass CSS

A quick script to use this image
```bash
#!/bin/sh
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/opt/app funayman/webtools:latest $@
```
